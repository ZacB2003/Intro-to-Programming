 * This repository exists for the purpose of __class assignments__ in my upcoming course.
 * I am a Sophomore at Valley High School with experience in Graphic Design, Computer Programming, and Computer Science as a whole.
 * I am taking this course because I have a desire to know the ins and outs of computer science and how our computers and digital machines work. My goals for the future also go hand-in-hand with computer science fundamentals. My goal is to complete this course with a detailed knowledge of the contents of this course and to be able to enter the workforce and put those skills to the test.
